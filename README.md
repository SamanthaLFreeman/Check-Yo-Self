# Check Yo' Self

### Project Description
Check Yo' Self is a site for users to save their tasks locally and check off once completed. Once they've checked off all of the items on the card, they will be able to remove that task from their screen. In addition, they can use the search feature or 'Filter by Urgency' button to filter cards. If the user is not happy with what they are creating in the side nav. Then they just click on the 'Clear All' button to start over creating a new task on the left side. Lastly, this site is responsive and is viewable on phones.

### Learning Goals
For this Mod One project at Turing, I increased my understanding of how to iterate/filter dom elements utilizing loops and array prototypes. In addition, worked on a stronger understanding of the difference between the data model and how data is displayed on the DOM. Lastly, developed a strong UI/UX that matches the comps expectations.
